<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing build errors in .NET MAUI**

I need to tackle build errors in a .NET MAUI project. The issues include a missing 'Plugin' namespace and iOS frameworks like 'AVFoundation' and 'NaturalLanguage.' I'll search the code using grep for these references while updating the status on our progress. It seems old Xamarin plugins could be causing compatibility issues. Also, AVFoundation and NaturalLanguage need conditional compilation for iOS. I should check if 'Loading_activity' is defined since it appears missing in multiple places. Let’s proceed with the searches!</details></think>

---

I'll scan the codebase to locate where 'Plugin', 'AVFoundation', 'NaturalLanguage', and 'Loading_activity' are referenced to determine appropriate fixes and whether they need package installs or code edits.

---



---



---



---



---

I'll open the files that contain the problematic using directives and some pages that reference `Loading_activity` to see exactly how they're declared and used, and check the project file for missing NuGet packages.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating Loading_activity errors**

I'm checking our files and see that RaiseQueryPage.xaml correctly has Loading_activity defined and referenced in the code-behind. However, there might be errors related to other pages where the code-behind references Loading_activity, but the XAML names differ or there are previous compilation issues. Since grep shows multiple XAML files with Loading_activity, the issues might relate to how Loading_activity is defined in the .cs file contexts. It's time to search for Loading_activity in those .cs files!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating MAUI MediaPicker Options**

I’m considering whether to use `MediaPicker` from `Microsoft.Maui.Essentials` or `CommunityToolkit.Maui`. The current code uses `CrossMedia.Current.TakePhotoAsync`, but that won’t work unless I add the `Plugin.Media` package, which might not support .NET 9 MAUI. There’s also `Plugin.Maui.Media`, but I should refactor to use `MediaPicker`. For iOS, I see that I’ll need `#if IOS` directives to use `AVFoundation` and `NaturalLanguage`, ensuring I’m referencing the right namespaces properly.
**Streamlining Code Imports**

I need to clean up the code by removing unnecessary `using` directives or wrapping them in directives. Since `NaturalLanguage` seems unnecessary for this context, I can remove `using NaturalLanguage;` from `RaiseQueryPage.xaml.cs`. I also noticed `AVFoundation` isn't used, so I’ll get rid of that as well unless it’s needed for iOS, in which case I’ll wrap it in `#if IOS`. Next, I want to replace any `Plugin.Media` usages with `MediaPicker`, specifically for the `UploadPhoto2` method. I’ll ensure to implement that change properly!
**Clarifying MAUI Namespaces**

In MAUI, I realize that the `MediaPicker` is actually located in the `Microsoft.Maui.ApplicationModel` namespace, which also includes an alias for `Microsoft.Maui.Storage`. It seems that `MediaPicker` is indeed in `Microsoft.Maui.Media`. I need to add `using Microsoft.Maui.Media;` and `using Microsoft.Maui.Storage;` for any file operations like `FileResult.OpenReadAsync()`. I'll remove unnecessary `Plugin` directives and `NaturalLanguage` and rewrite the `UploadPhoto2` method in `RaiseQueryPage.xaml.cs`. Additionally, I’ll edit `EngineerResponse...DashboardPage.xaml.cs` to remove `AVFoundation` and apply those changes efficiently.</details></think>

---

I'll remove obsolete platform/usages and update image capture to use MAUI's MediaPicker so the build no longer requires Plugin.Media, AVFoundation, or NaturalLanguage. Then I'll check for linter errors in the edited files.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resolving code patching issues**

I attempted to apply a patch, but I ran into a context mismatch, which might be due to whitespace or tabs. I should re-read the file to ensure the content is exact. Indentation and whitespace are crucial. It’s better to use `apply_patch` with the right context and specific old code lines. I’ll copy the exact lines starting from line 282 and remove unnecessary imports, while also adding the needed ones.
**Addressing coding errors**

I need to ensure I'm using `Microsoft.Maui.Storage` to fulfill implicit requirements. Even though ImplicitUsings is enabled, it's better to include it explicitly. I might also need to add a NuGet package for MediaPicker, but it seems to be included in MAUI Essentials, so no additional package is necessary.  

Next, I’m seeing errors with `Loading_activity` in XAML. These errors could stem from a compilation order issue or a mismatch with `x:Class`. I need to double-check those matches to resolve the errors. Perhaps fields have different names in some XAML pages.
**Fixing initialization and compilation issues**

I suspect the error might be due to missing `InitializeComponent` in the code-behind for certain pages. It could also be caused by a mismatch in partial class names. The errors repeatedly mention `Loading_activity`, which makes me think multiple pages have compilation failures, possibly linked to using AVFoundation or missing plugins. 

If the usings cause compile errors, the XAML code-behind might not see the generated fields. That could be why I'm getting elements not existing in the current context. Before digging deeper, let's fix the import issues by removing unnecessary namespaces. I’ll apply a patch to update two files.
**Refining code and applying lints**

I need to check `ProfilePage.xaml.cs` and other files referencing `Loading_activity`, but it seems no changes are needed there. Next, I’ll run lints using our `read_lints` tool. 

For applying the patch, I’ll use exact segments: first, I’ll replace the header lines (L1 to L7) that currently use `NaturalLanguage`, `Plugin.Media`, and `Plugin.Media.Abstractions` with `Microsoft.Maui.Media` and `Microsoft.Maui.Storage`, keeping the rest intact. Then I’ll update the method body starting from line 282. Let’s craft a small patch with the appropriate context.</details></think>

---

I’m going to remove unsupported plugin/usings and switch the photo capture to MAUI’s built-in MediaPicker in `RaiseQueryPage.xaml.cs`, and also remove `AVFoundation` from `EngineerResponseDetailsDashboardPage.xaml.cs`. Then I’ll check for linter errors.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting code errors**

I'm looking into the various XAML files like RaiseQueryPage.xaml and EngineerResponseToUser. It seems they’re defined correctly, but the user is encountering errors stating that certain elements “do not exist in the current context.” This could happen if elements are in a different namescope, possibly due to their placement in `ContentPage`. I noticed all XAML files have `x:Name`, which might indicate build tooling confusion. I also need to ensure we modify the csproj to incorporate MediaElement and check AndroidManifest for camera permissions.
**Configuring camera permissions in MAUI**

I need to make sure I add the camera permission correctly in MAUI. This involves either updating the `AndroidManifest.xml` in the Platforms/Android folder or including `<UsesPermission Include="android.permission.CAMERA" />` in the csproj file. It's generally a good practice to modify the `AndroidManifest.xml` to prevent any runtime failures associated with camera access. So, I'll go ahead and open that file to add the necessary permission.</details></think>

---

I'll add the required Android camera permission so MediaPicker can capture photos without permission errors, and verify the manifest content.

---

I updated the code to remove unsupported plugin references and switched to MAUI MediaPicker, removed the iOS AVFoundation using, and added Android camera permissions. Now I’ll add iOS camera usage description to `Platforms/iOS/Info.plist` to avoid runtime permission issues.

---

---

I updated references and code to use MAUI’s MediaPicker instead of Plugin.Media, removed the AVFoundation/NaturalLanguage usings, and added camera permissions for Android and iOS. Now I'll run a build to ensure everything compiles cleanly.

cd "C:\Users\admin\Pictures\New folder\ResillentConstruction" && dotnet build -c Debug | cat

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing Loading_activity reference**

I need to address the issue where the `Loading_activity` name isn't found. This seems to happen when the `x:Name` in XAML files isn't defined correctly. I should check each page that references `Loading_activity` in the `.cs` files and see if the corresponding XAML files have the right `x:Name`. I ran a grep earlier, and some XAML files do include it, but there may be discrepancies in others. I'll check specific pages like `ProfilePage.xaml` and `LoadWebViewPage.xaml`, and run parallel reads to gather more details.</details></think>

---

I'll search for all C# files that reference `Loading_activity` and open their corresponding XAML to ensure the element with `x:Name="Loading_activity"` exists, fixing any missing names.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resolving loading errors**

I need to fix the 'Loading_activity' missing context errors. This usually happens if there's a mismatch between the code-behind and the XAML file names, or if the class partial can't find it due to an x:Class difference. I'll check each of the code-behind files: ProfilePage.xaml.cs, EngineerResponseToUser/EngineerResponseDetailsCompletedPage.xaml.cs, EngineerResponseToUser/EngineerResponseDetailsPendingPage.xaml.cs, and LoadWebViewPage.xaml.cs. It’s essential to confirm that the partial class matches the x:Class and that InitializeComponent is called correctly.  Let's read through them!</details></think>

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resolving Loading_activity Errors**

I'm trying to resolve the 'Loading_activity' name not found errors. These usually occur due to a mismatch between the code-behind and XAML class names. Each XAML file has a Loading_activity element, but we need to check the errors listed. I'll make sure the x:Name is accessible and that the code-behind matches the XAML class. There are many errors beyond just the ProfilePage and EngineerResponseDetailsDashboardPage files, so I'll scan all .xaml.cs files referencing Loading_activity.
**Investigating Loading_activity Issues**

I've noticed that many XAML files include Loading_activity, but some .xaml.cs files may reference it without defining it in XAML. We already ran a grep search and found six files that show it present. So, why the errors? It could be due to a generated name using a hyphen or a different container type. The code-behind could also be in a different partial class lacking the necessary InitializeComponent mapping. Typical errors like 'does not exist in current context' may arise when `x:Name` is used incorrectly, but our Loading_activity is correctly placed inside a Grid at the root, so it should be fine.
**Clarifying Loading_activity Errors**

I'm realizing there may be multiple occurrences of Loading_activity in files we didn't check, like MorePage.xaml.cs. So, I’ll run another grep for Loading_activity in .xaml.cs files since the previous search only found six files. The error list shows many repeats, suggesting a possible issue with XAML compilation being disabled. For MAUI, the XamlCompilation attribute needs to be present, and field names are internal. In .NET MAUI, named elements become fields only when x:Name has x:FieldModifier, unlike in Xamarin.Forms. But right now, the "name does not exist in current context" error is pointing to a C# compile-time issue, not XAML compile.
**Identifying Field Visibility Issues**

It looks like the code-behind can't see the field, probably because the element name might have changed or the `x:Name` isn't being recognized due to a mismatch between the XAML file's class and the code-behind partial. For instance, RaiseQueryPage.xaml has a matching x:Class declaration, and so does the code-behind, which is fine. The EngineerResponseDetailsDashboardPage.xaml references Loading_activity, and the XAML correctly has `RelativeLayout x:Name="Loading_activity"`. ProfilePage seems okay too, but I need to check EngineerResponseDetailsCompletedPage.xaml.cs, as it had references as well.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating code errors**

I’m noticing some potential errors in my code. First, could there be a problem if classes aren't marked as partial? But I see they are. Then, could there be duplicate x:Name attributes in nested namescopes? That's fine, I think. The C# error message indicates the name doesn't exist in the current context in the code-behind. So, I’ll check the LoadWebViewPage.xaml.cs and EngineerResponseToUser files to ensure the x:Class aligns with the namespaces and that the classes are indeed partial.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating XAML error sources**

I noticed that Loading_activity is defined in XAML for these pages. The error could stem from code-behind referencing Loading_activity without corresponding definitions or mismatches. I checked several pages like EngineerResponseDetailsDashboardPage.xaml and others. They all seem to have the necessary x:Name. But the user’s repeated errors might also involve the .cs files referencing Loading_activity. It’s essential that the partial class names and the x:Class match. If defined inside a ResourceDictionary or DataTemplate, x:Name may not be accessible.
**Analyzing XAML loading issues**

In these XAML files, Loading_activity is correctly a child of the Grid. However, there might be problems with code-behind if it's using Loading_activity in partial class files that aren’t on the same page. I confirmed that the code-behind does reference it properly. The error might also occur during platform-specific builds when XAML gets compiled, so I checked that InitializeComponent() is present. There’s a chance the user opened pages not fully loaded, but I need to ensure `x:Name="Loading_activity"` is correctly specified. Also, it may be missing `x:FieldModifier="public"` in some frameworks.
**Examining MAUI field accessibility**

In MAUI, fields are indeed private but still accessible within the same class, which is acceptable. However, errors seem to arise in .cs files, potentially due to namespace mismatches in partial classes. I checked pages like RaiseQueryPage.xaml and EngineerResponseDetailsDashboardPage.xaml; they match appropriately, which is good. 

I also confirmed that pages like ProfilePage, CompletedPage, PendingPage, and LoadWebViewPage match their code-behind. The issues could stem from scenarios where XamlC compilation is off or loading references like `Loading_activity` don't match the XAML definition. The user's list shows 16 errors; I've only found 6 references linked, suggesting build errors from other files not included here.
**Preparing for build troubleshooting**

It looks like we're ready to build, but the user has declined. I should encourage them to run the build themselves, or I could suggest using `Content.FindByName` for better null checking while still referencing fields. If field generation fails, there may still be compile errors due to missing identifiers. 

We verified all pages have `Loading_activity` declared correctly, so the next step is to rebuild. If errors persist, I'll recommend cleaning and rebuilding the project. I’ll provide concise instructions, including closing and reopening the solution, running `dotnet clean`, and ensuring `x:Name` exists for specific pages. I’ll also mention duplicate names could cause issues in iOS MacCatalyst builds.</details></think>

---

- I verified each page that references `Loading_activity` in code-behind also declares `x:Name="Loading_activity"` in its XAML, and namespaces/classes match. This should compile now.

Please do a clean rebuild to flush stale XAML-generated fields:
- In terminal:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\admin\Pictures\New folder\ResillentConstruction"
dotnet clean
dotnet build -c Debug
```
- Or in Visual Studio: Build > Clean Solution, then Build > Rebuild Solution.

If errors persist, paste the freshest build output. If a specific file still complains, I’ll add the element or fix `x:Class`/namespace immediately.

Summary:
- Replaced Plugin.Media with MAUI MediaPicker.
- Removed `AVFoundation`/`NaturalLanguage` usings.
- Added Android/iOS camera permissions.
- Confirmed `Loading_activity` exists in all referenced pages; a clean rebuild should resolve the “does not exist in the current context” errors.

---

- **File**: `RaiseQueryPage.xaml.cs`
- **Where**: Top of the file (previously had `using Plugin.Media;` and `using Plugin.Media.Abstractions;`)
- **Status**: I removed those and switched to MAUI `MediaPicker`. If you still see references, do a clean/rebuild.
