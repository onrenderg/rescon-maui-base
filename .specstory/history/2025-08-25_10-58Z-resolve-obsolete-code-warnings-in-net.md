_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing build errors**

I need to address the build error and warnings I'm encountering. The error points to the MainPage.xaml.sg.cs file, specifically referencing Loading_activity, which seems to be an issue with an x:Name in XAML or the code-behind. I should open both MainPage.xaml and MainPage.xaml.cs. A good step is to search for Loading_activity across the solution using grep. After that, I'll either define the control in XAML or remove any references to it. Let’s get started on this search!</details></think>

---

I'll search the codebase for the missing symbol to locate where `Loading_activity` should be defined and fix the XAML or code-behind accordingly. Then I'll address the obsolete `Frame` warnings by queuing a follow-up todo to migrate to `Border`.

---



---



---

I'll open `MainPage.xaml` and its code-behind to see how `Loading_activity` is declared and referenced, then fix the mismatch causing the missing name error. I'll also check `MainPage.xaml.sg.cs` reference context indirectly by ensuring the XAML is in the correct namescope.

---

Read file: undefined

---

Read file: undefined

---



---

I'll open the generated file to see exactly where and why `Loading_activity` is referenced incorrectly. Then I'll adjust `MainPage.xaml` if needed.

---

Could not find file 'C:\Users\admin\Pictures\New folder\ResillentConstruction\obj\Debug\net9.0-android\Microsoft.Maui.Controls.SourceGen\Microsoft.Maui.Controls.SourceGen.CodeBehindGenerator\MainPage.xaml.sg.cs' in the workspace.

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering layout conflicts**

I’m running into naming conflicts with field or property names in the page class. For instance, the MainPage class doesn’t have a property named Loading_activity. Maybe we could try a clean build, but we can’t run at the moment. An alternative is to change the overlay in MainPage.xaml from RelativeLayout to Grid or ContentView with AbsoluteLayout, which others are using. It's possible that the generator got confused, so wrapping the overlay in Grid with ZIndex for namespacing might help.
**Fixing naming issues**

I think the error might persist if the generator specifically references Loading_activity. It bases references on x:Name, so if I rename it, the generator should update the references too. I’ll implement this by renaming x:Name from Loading_activity to LoadingOverlay in MainPage.xaml. It might also make sense to change the element from RelativeLayout to ContentView for consistency, though just a minimal rename could work too. I’ll go ahead and make those edits. The Frame obsolete warnings can wait since they’re not errors.</details></think>

---

I'll rename the `x:Name` in `MainPage.xaml` from `Loading_activity` to `LoadingOverlay` to resolve the generator symbol mismatch causing the CS0103 error.

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting XAML issues**

I edited the XAML by renaming a name. However, I'm considering whether the code-behind might still refer to "Loading_activity." In the MainPage.xaml.cs, there doesn't seem to be a reference. The error pointed to several lines in sg.cs, indicating that "Loading_activity" doesn't exist in the current context. I think this could be because the named element isn't found, or maybe it's an issue with the RelativeLayout not being in the correct namescope. Renaming it to "LoadingOverlay" might not resolve the issue if other code-behind files reference "Loading_activity."
**Addressing build errors**

Renaming to "LoadingOverlay" will create a field with that name, so the sg.cs will reference it. However, the error might still occur if the generator is using a stale file. There are warnings about Frame being obsolete, and we should update the to-do list, although we haven’t created one yet. For a minor fix, we could skip the todos, but I realize I need to provide a brief status update and discuss possibly running a build with "dotnet build." 

Let's run that command now!</details></think>

---

I'll run a quick build to verify the rename resolved the CS0103 error and see remaining warnings.

```bash
cd "C:\Users\admin\Pictures\New folder\ResillentConstruction" && dotnet build ResillentConstruction.sln -c Debug | cat

**Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Xaml.XamlParseException:** 'Position 24:10. Type converter failed: Cannot convert "Default" into Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Color'

[libc] Requested dump for pid 9018 (entconstruction)

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting XAML Exception**

I need to resolve an XAML parse exception regarding a type converter failing to convert "Default" into a valid color. It seems related to the Shadow property, which is likely invalid syntax here. In MAUI, the Border needs an IBrush for the Stroke property, so using "DeepSkyBlue" works. Plus, the Shadow property isn't available on Border; I need to refer to the Shadow element instead. I'll need to check the MainPage.xaml file for edits to investigate further.</details></think>

---

I'll open `MainPage.xaml` to locate the invalid attribute causing the XAML color conversion error and fix it.

---

Read file: undefined

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating XamlParseException**

I need to address the XamlParseException that says, "Cannot convert 'Default' into Microsoft.Maui.Graphics.Color." The error points to position 24:10, which is at the end of TitleView. I should check line 24 in MainPage.xaml to see if "Default" is incorrectly assigned to a Color property. I'll search the file for "Default" to locate the issue. Let's see what I can find!</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Applying code edits**

I don't see the "Default" string, but I think this fix likely resolves the issue. We renamed Loading_overlay earlier, and the code-behind references lbl_navigation_header and lbl_footer, which exist, so that's good. We also migrated Frames to Borders in MainPage. Now, I’ll edit MainPage.xaml to replace both Borders with Shadow children as mentioned. Using "HorizontalOptions=Fill" in the TitleView Grid seems fine too. Alright, let's proceed with the patch!</details></think>

---



---

- I replaced the invalid Shadow attribute syntax with the proper `Border.Shadow` element to fix the color type converter error.

Please rebuild and run again. If another XAML parse error appears, share the new message.

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting XAML error**

I’m dealing with a "Default" color issue tied to properties like "Shadow" or perhaps even "Border." There's a stack trace that might lead to another XAML file, but it mentions a specific position in the current file. It seems like the error may stem from removing `ios:Page.UseSafeArea` and the ios namespace. I should also check for styles in `App.xaml` that use "Default" for TextColor or BackgroundColor. Ultimately, a search for "Default" in XAML files using grep is a good idea.</details></think>

I'll search XAML files for any usage of the string "Default" that could be parsed as a Color and adjust it to a valid MAUI color value.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing color in App.xaml**

I need to fix the App.xaml file where it's trying to use "Default" as a color. It seems that MAUI Color can’t accept "Default" as a string, so I should change it to either Transparent or null instead. The error is at line 24, position 10, so I’ll go ahead and open App.xaml to confirm that and make the necessary changes. Let’s see what’s going on there!</details></think>
